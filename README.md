# Please CLI

An AI helper script to create CLI commands.

## Usage

```bash
./please <command>
```
This will call GPT to generate a Linux command based on your input.

```bash
./please list all files smaller than 1MB in the current folder, \
         sort them by size and show their name and line count
🔡 Command:
  find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -size -1M -exec wc -l {} + | sort -n -k1

Parameters:
- -e or --explanation will explain the command for you
- -l or --legacy will use the GPT3.5 AI model instead of GPT4 (in case you don't have API access to GPT4
- -v or --version will show you the current version
- -h or --help will show the help message

## Prerequisites

You need an OpenAI API key. You can get one here: https://beta.openai.com/

The API key needs to be set:
- either via an ENV variable OPENAI_API_KEY
- via a keychain entry OPENAI_API_KEY (MacOS keychain and secret-tool on Linux are supported)

To set the API key via an environment variable, run

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

To store your API key using secret-tool, run

```bash
secret-tool store --label="OpenAI API Key" OPENAI_API_KEY <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

To store your API key using MacOS keychain, run

```bash
security add-generic-password -a <YOUR_API_KEY> -s OPENAI_API_KEY -w
```
