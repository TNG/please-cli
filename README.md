# Please CLI

An AI helper script to create CLI commands.

## Usage

This will call GPT to generate a Linux command based on your input.

```bash
./please.sh list all files smaller than 1MB in the current folder, sort them by size and show their name and line count
🔡 Command:
  find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -size -1M -exec wc -l {} + | sort -n -k1

❗ What should I do? [use arrow keys to navigate]
> Execute
  Copy to clipboard
  Cancel
```

Parameters:
- -e or --explanation will explain the command for you
- -l or --legacy will use the GPT3.5 AI model instead of GPT4 (in case you don't have API access to GPT4
- -h or --help will show the help message
